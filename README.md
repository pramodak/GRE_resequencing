# GRE_resequencing
Linux GRE packet resequencing module.
The src directory contains the header and source files. Also, a patch file is present for patching the different files using Linux patch utility.

This module is tested with Linux kernel version 3.13.0-85. But, GRe module files are rarely changed, so, the patch could be applied to later kernels as well (but, with CAUTION).
